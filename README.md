# Popi
Permutation Of Personal Information (wordlist creator).

This is just a small project to improve my string/list skills.

The program is not for more general wordlists, it's recommended to use it only if you want a wordlist that contains abbreviations and small parts of the information passed on.

Popi asks you for name, surname, and birthday of the target but if you pass some arguments also ask about mother father and pet.

You can contribute in the following things:
  * report a bug.
  * sharing ideas.
  * organizing or improving the code.

 Email me popis-developer@protonmail.com.
 
*sometimes if you allow mother or/and father or/and pet after the message generating wordlist, script get killed* 
*I think it's because the wordlist got too large*
*I'm working on it*

*--sorry for some bugs in the code, I have no time to fix
